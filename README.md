# Go Lang Learning Repo

Welcome to my **GoLang Learning Repository**! üöÄ

I've been wanting to try **Go (Golang)** for a long time, and this repo is where I document my journey of learning it from scratch. Each folder contains code related to different Go concepts, from basic syntax to advanced topics.

Each folder focuses on a specific Go concept.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run Code

To run any specific lesson except webapp, use the following command:

```sh
go run <foldername>/main.go
```

For example, to run the **pointers** lesson:

```sh
go run 15_pointers/main.go
```

For WebApp use the following command (providing path to config):

```sh
go run cmd/webapp/main.go -config config/local.yaml
```

## üìñ Topics Covered

- **Basics** (Variables, Constants, Data Types)
- **Control Structures** (Loops, Conditionals, Switch)
- **Arrays & Slices**
- **Maps & Ranges**
- **Functions & Closures**
- **Pointers**
- **Structs & Interfaces**
- **Concurrency** (Goroutines, WaitGroups, Channels, Mutex)
- **File Handling**
- **Streaming**
- **Packages & Modules**

## üî• Why Go?

Go is a powerful, fast, and efficient language built for scalability and concurrency. This repo helps me learn and apply Go concepts as I progress.
